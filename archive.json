We assume U can identify V in the following.)\r\n\r\nWe write in section 3.2:\r\n> The domain authenticator may in principle use differents credentials for authenticating to the  authorization server and to the device, for which PK_V is used.\r\n\r\nSo in the general case V may use something other than PK_V to authenticate to W. Moreover, to identify V it must be unique and securely associated to the public key V uses with W, for which a CCS may not be sufficient (in contrast to what V presents to U, since U will have access to a voucher which can be used to verify a CCS). \r\n\r\nIn the meeting I think we mentioned ID_V could be a common name in subject or subject alt name in a certificate that V will use to authenticate to W. The name need to come from a specific name space agreed out of band and managed by a CA trusted by W. \r\n\r\nDo we want to formulate such an example or have a more general text (or both)? I will try to formulate something that you can review. More comments welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We assume U can identify V in the following.)\r\n\r\nSo that is really technology specific and it's a good point that you brought it up. In 6TiSCH, enhanced beacons (EB) are authenticity-protected with a tag, but the key is not known to U until after it has joined the network. We had a similar chicken-and-egg problem in RFC9031 and we resolved this by having U attempt to join a network, remember the ID (ID_V in this case) and the EB content, and then once U has joined the network and obtained network link-layer keys, it verified the authenticity of the EB that triggered the join. Something similar could be done here but I don't think this level of technology-specific details belong to this draft.\r\n\r\n> So in the general case V may use something other than PK_V to authenticate to W. Moreover, to identify V it must be unique and securely associated to the public key V uses with W, for which a CCS may not be sufficient (in contrast to what V presents to U, since U will have access to a voucher which can be used to verify a CCS).\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, good point that CCS is not enough on the V-W segment.\r\n\r\n> In the meeting I think we mentioned ID_V could be a common name in subject or subject alt name in a certificate that V will use to authenticate to W. The name need to come from a specific name space agreed out of band and managed by a CA trusted by W.\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure on the cleanest way to do this given that CCS is used between V-U. \r\n",
